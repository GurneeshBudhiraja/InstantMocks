InstantMocks

## Project Description

#### InstantMocks allows the developers to create ephemeral dynamic mock APIs in under a minute. <br/> The developers around the globe usually face the problem of having a real test data while developing the frontend/backend APIs and usually end up considering assumptions which leads to the unexpected bugs in production. <br/> This not only leads to the loss of time but also reduces the efficiency of the developers. <br/> Therefore, below are the features InstantMocks provide to enhance the developers' experience and fix the above problems:

- üîì No authentication required. This helps the developers to quickly setup the mock APIs for their projects.
- ‚ö° The developers could generate APIs that serve both hardcoded and dynamic responses using Gemini AI.
- üîç The developers could use Gemini AI to generate schema for the APIs which are based on real API response.
- üí´ Out of the box support for the different HTTP methods.
- üîÑ Easily share the created mock APIs with anyone.
- ‚è≥ The APIs are ephemeral by nature with a maximum 1 hour validity.

## Inspiration behind the Project

#### The inspiration of this project stems from my own experience. During my time of learning the frontend I have always struggled to find APIs that I could integrate quickly and easily while making sure less of migration work with real APIs. After talking to my juniors and reading Reddit comments, I knew there needs to exist a tool like this. <br/> Therefore, I thought what better project than creating a tool for the developers that help them setup mock APIs instantly, without any hassle, and using a tool that is open source. <br/> I hoped this tool existed when I was getting started out and thanks to the Appwrite hackathon that pushed me to create a tool for the new developers.

> This project is my little way to return back to the open source community and next generation of developers ‚ù§Ô∏è
